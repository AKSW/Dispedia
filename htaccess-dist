# OntoWiki .htaccess file
#

#
# OntoWiki does not requires Apache's rewrite engine to work.
# However, if you would like to have nice Linked Data URIs
# you must enable URL rewriting by renaming this file
# to .htaccess and enabling mod_rewrite.
#
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
    RewriteEngine On
    
    # New rule -- does work!
    RewriteRule !((extensions|libraries).*|\.(js|ico|gif|jpg|png|css|php|swf|json))$ index.php
    
    # Zend-recommended rule --  doesn't work :\
#   RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -s [OR]
#   RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -l [OR]
#   RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -d
#   RewriteRule ^.*$ - [NC,L]
#   RewriteRule ^.*$ index.php [NC,L]
    
    # Old rule -- doesn't work either

# Set RewriteBase only if your OntoWiki folder is not
