This installation guide is for MySQL Backend users. If you want to use
OntoWiki with Apache and Virtuoso or within Virtuoso as a VAD Package
please have a look at our Virtuoso Setup Guide:
http://code.google.com/p/ontowiki/wiki/UsingOntoWikiWithVirtuoso

If you want to use OntoWiki with MySQL, here we go ... we assume, you
have copied the content of the release archive to your webdirectory.

1. create a mysql user for ontowiki (e.g. ontowiki)

2. create a mysql database which is writable for the ontowiki user

3. copy the config.ini-dist to config.ini and change the database config:
   in most cases, you have to change only these values
   store.zenddb.dbname, store.zenddb.username, store.zenddb.password

4. Start your OntoWiki Installation in your browser. All tables are
   created automatically and hopefully, you will see a starting screen
   containing a news area and a login window.

Now you have a fresh new OntoWiki Installation. If you are new to OntoWiki,
maybe it is interesting for you to visit out First Steps documentation:

If you need further help or want to communicate with other users and the 
developers, feel free use the OntoWiki User Mailinglist at GoogleGroups:
