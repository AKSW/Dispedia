"""Over the past 3 years, the semantic web activity has gained momentum with the widespread publishing of structured data as RDF. The Linked Data paradigm has therefore evolved from a practical research idea into a very promising candidate for addressing one of the biggest challenges in the area of intelligent information management: the exploitation of the Web as a platform for data and information integration in addition to document search. To translate this initial success into a world-scale disruptive reality, encompassing the Web 2.0 world and enterprise data alike, the following research challenges need to be addressed: improve coherence and quality of data published on the Web, close the performance gap between relational and RDF data management, establish trust on the Linked Data Web and generally lower the entrance barrier for data publishers and users. With partners among those who initiated and strongly supported the Linked Open Data initiative, the LOD2 project aims at tackling these challenges by developing:
<ol>
<li>enterprise-ready tools and methodologies for exposing and managing very large amounts of structured information on the Data Web,</li>
<li>a testbed and bootstrap network of high-quality multi-domain, multi-lingual ontologies from sources such as Wikipedia and OpenStreetMap.</li>
<li>algorithms based on machine learning for automatically interlinking and fusing data from the Web.</li>
<li>standards and methods for reliably tracking provenance, ensuring privacy and data security as well as for assessing the quality of information.</li>
<li>adaptive tools for searching, browsing, and authoring of Linked Data.</li>
</ol>
We will integrate and syndicate linked data with large-scale, existing applications and showcase the benefits in the three application scenarios of media & publishing, corporate data intranets and eGovernment. The resulting tools, methods and data sets have the potential to change the Web as we know it today.

Secondly, case studies are also used to validate the results and evaluate their applicability and impact. User centric activities will, additionally, validate our technologies viz. provide the evaluation environment. Each case study will incorporate a technology partner who is responsible for supporting the use case partners in deploying and using LOD2 R&D results and for feeding back business requirements to the R&D.""".

While user-centric activities represent the customer perspective, this activity takes concrete steps towards successful exploitation from the point of view of the R&D partners. There are two major factors, which determine the impact and thus the exploitation potential of an IP: cost and benefit. Key to exploitation is the project visibility – making prospective users and the prospective community in general aware of the project’s benefits.
