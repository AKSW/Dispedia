All of the scientific partners have outstanding scientific reputations, and some of them are leaders in their respective fields. In particular with CWIâ€™s outstanding reputation in the database world, LOD2 will substantially contribute to cross-fertilization between database and semantic web research. The LOD2 consortium has the required engineering power provided by TenForce, Exalead and OpenLink Software. The consortium also has the required dissemination and exploitation expertise provided by its innovative SMEs (Exalead, Openlink, TenForce and SWC), a large corporation (WKD) and the eGovernment and Open Knowledge communities represented in the consortium by OKFN. Within efforts such as the Linking Open Data effort, DBpedia and MonetDB (and numerous smaller community projects), the project partners have already demonstrated that they can achieve high-impact results and ensure the global dissemination and maximum impact of their work.""".

The project aims to contribute high-quality interlinked versions of public Semantic Web data sets, promoting their use in new cross-domain applications by developers across the globe. The new technologies for enabling scalable management of Linked Data collections in the many billions of triples will raise the state of the art of Semantic Web data management, both commercial and open-source, providing opportunities for new products and spin-offs, and make RDF a viable choice for organizations worldwide as a premier data management format. The algorithms and (open-source) tools that the project will develop for data cleaning, linking and fusing will help creating and bootstrapping new data sets in domains that go much beyond the direct applications and data sets developed in the context of this project, to reach the overall goal of the project of making Linked Data the model of choice for next-generation IT systems and applications.""".

"""Over the past 3 years, the semantic web activity has gained momentum with the widespread publishing of structured data as RDF. The Linked Data paradigm has therefore evolved from a practical research idea into a very promising candidate for addressing one of the biggest challenges in the area of intelligent information management: the exploitation of the Web as a platform for data and information integration in addition to document search. To translate this initial success into a world-scale disruptive reality, encompassing the Web 2.0 world and enterprise data alike, the following research challenges need to be addressed: improve coherence and quality of data published on the Web, close the performance gap between relational and RDF data management, establish trust on the Linked Data Web and generally lower the entrance barrier for data publishers and users. With partners among those who initiated and strongly supported the Linked Open Data initiative, the LOD2 project aims at tackling these challenges by developing:
<ol>
<li>enterprise-ready tools and methodologies for exposing and managing very large amounts of structured information on the Data Web,</li>
<li>a testbed and bootstrap network of high-quality multi-domain, multi-lingual ontologies from sources such as Wikipedia and OpenStreetMap.</li>
<li>algorithms based on machine learning for automatically interlinking and fusing data from the Web.</li>
<li>standards and methods for reliably tracking provenance, ensuring privacy and data security as well as for assessing the quality of information.</li>
<li>adaptive tools for searching, browsing, and authoring of Linked Data.</li>
</ol>
We will integrate and syndicate linked data with large-scale, existing applications and showcase the benefits in the three application scenarios of media & publishing, corporate data intranets and eGovernment. The resulting tools, methods and data sets have the potential to change the Web as we know it today.
